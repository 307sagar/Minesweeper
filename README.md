# Minesweeper
Minesweeper repo  - Contains a vanilla JS implementation for Minesweeper, and a React JS implementation.


1. Vanilla JS + HTML Implementation runs fine by just running the html file.

2. The React implementation is working fine in terms of feature, only the UI/COSMETIC things are pending. I Wanted to share the react one importantly but due t time constraint I had to share this
